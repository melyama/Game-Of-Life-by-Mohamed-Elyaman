This is a personal copy of the game of life created by  the English Mathematician John Conway.
The game operates by the following simple rules:

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies as if by overpopulation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

To play the game run the gameLoop.py file, then select the cells to revive with left click. If you wish to undo a cell,
use the right click button on the mouse. You can drag the mouse to select/deselect mutiple cells at once. Once the selection process is completed,
press space bar once to run the game logic.

If you desire to pause/stop the game logic, simply press space bar a second time. If you would like to restart, either
deselect the cells you want to remove using right click or exit the game by clicking the exit button on the top
right hand corner of the window and re-run this program.

To run this program you will need to have a python interpreter installed as well as the pygame package. See online
documentation for help installing these.
